                element bound together by chemical bonds. There are four kinds of compounds, depending on how the

                <mark>Any material containing two or more different kinds of atoms (chemical elements) in a fixed
                    stoichiometric ratio can be called as a chemical compound;</mark> the idea is most readily
                understood when considering pure chemical materials. It follows from their being made of a fixed ratio
                of two or more kinds of atoms that chemical compounds can be transformed, through a chemical reaction,
                into compounds or materials each having fewer atoms.

                Chemical compounds contain a unique and defined chemical configuration bind together in a definite
                three-dimensional arrangement by chemical bonds. Chemical compounds might be molecular compounds which
                are held together by covalent bonds, salts that are held together by ionic bonds, intermetallic
                compounds which are held together by metallic bonds, or the subset of chemical complexes that are bound
                together by coordinate covalent bonds. Chemical elements which are in pure form are usually not as
                considered chemical compounds, failing into having two or more atom requirement, though they often
                contain molecules made up of multiple atoms. <mark>Several chemical compounds have a distinct numerical
                    identifier assigned by the Chemical Abstracts Service (CAS)</mark>:
