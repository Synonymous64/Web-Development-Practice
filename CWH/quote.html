<h1 title="&quot;Not the critic&quot;">
  Don't be afraid to be &lt;then a 
  100% success &amp; &gt;more:
</h1>
<p>
  "It is not the critic who counts;
  not the man who points out how
  the strong man stumbles, or where
  the doer of deeds could have done
    [... cut out to shorten ...]
  shall never be with those cold and
  timid souls who neither know victory
  nor defeat."
